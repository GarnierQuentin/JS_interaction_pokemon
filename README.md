The goal of this exercise was to create an interactive website using the PokéApi and javascript (localStorage, eventListener, ...)

# My project

## Homepage
On this project you will find a landing page explaining how to travel on the website and use all fonctionalities

## Products
The second page is where you will be able to see every Pokemon, and to choose which one you wanna add to your shopping list.

To choose, you can see the picture, types, stats and price of 30 different Pokemons.

## Shop

Finally, the last page but not least, gives you the possibility to see 
- all the Pokemons you reserved
- the total amount of how much it will cost you
- how much money you still have
- which Pokemon(s) delete from your list
- Paying
